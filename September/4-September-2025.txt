the initramfs generated by dracut also works with arch along with the newly compiled kernel that supports btrfs fs, not that it matters in arch

i am getting the following error after using fedora_everything:-

i think since fedora doesn't have a dedicated root user. it doesn't have a dedicated root directory
if it does get a dedicated root user then it may get a dedicated root directory which might solve the issue.

i will try reinstalling fedora tommorrow mourning with a dedicated root user cause it will take some time
