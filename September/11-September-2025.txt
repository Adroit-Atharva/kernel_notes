Each physical memory page can be mapped as one or more virtual
pages. 
(basically means that one or more virtual pages can be mapped to a single page frame)

These mappings are described by page tables that allow
translation from a virtual address used by programs to the physical
memory address. 

The page tables are organized hierarchically.

The tables at the lowest level of the hierarchy contain physical
addresses of actual pages used by the software. 

The tables at higher
levels contain physical addresses of the pages belonging to the lower
levels.

documentation is shit 

the above lines basically mean that lower level page tables' pages are directly mapped to the 
physical memory's pages.
and higher level tables' pages are mapped to its lower page table which is again mapped to some other
lower page table
