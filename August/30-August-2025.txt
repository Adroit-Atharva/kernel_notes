going to install fedora on qemu disk image of format qcow2

qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -cdrom Fedora-Everything-netinst-x86_64-42-1.1.iso \
  -drive file=fedora_everything.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -m 3G \
  -smp 3  

installing it on fedora_everything.qcow2 of 10G
created that using following command:-
qemu-img create -f qcow2 fedora_everything.qcow2 10G

after the installation use the following command to boot back into the system:-
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -drive file=fedora_everything.qcow2,format=qcow2 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -m 3G \
  -smp 3

it also saves the files inside the system and is very minimalistic
very happy to use fedora again

now can i just pass the compiled kernel and its initramfs to it,
i can pass the uuid of the virtual system as a kernel command using append 

fstab is in:-
/etc

inside the virtual fedora, UUID of its root is:-
UUID=dd384c01-d15a-4cc7-aa47-f5dc1990390e

//use the below command to run the compiled kernel
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -enable-kvm \
  -m 2048 \
  -kernel /boot/vmlinuz-6.15.7 \
  -initrd /boot/initramfs-6.15.7.img \
  -append "root=/dev/mapper/fedora-root ro console=ttyS0 rd.shell systemd.log_level=debug systemd.log_target=console" \
  -nographic


qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -m 2048 -kernel /boot/Atharva-linux-6.16.3 -initrd /boot/initramfs-linux-Atharva.img -append "root=UUID=dd384c01-d15a-4cc7-aa47-f5dc1990390e ro console=ttyS0" -nographic


after i do the following:-
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 3G -kernel /boot/Atharva-linux-6.16.3 -initrd /boot/initramfs-linux-Atharva.img -append "ro console=ttyS0" -nographic

i am getting the following error:-

it keeps giving the same error for all other versions of it:-
it keeps failing to mount the disk on the real root
what does 'real root' even mean?
probably the real rootfs 
mounting disk on real rootfs ?
not the other way round?

maybe the following command will work:-
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 3G -kernel /boot/Atharva-linux-6.16.3 -initrd /boot/initramfs-linux-Atharva.img -append "root=/home/atharva/Downloads/fedora_everything.qcow2 ro console=ttyS0" -nographic

dmesg doesn't help me much

maybe i should create a disk image, create a linux environment on it like last time and then use it as a kernel command line argument


need to mount qcow2
