i am watching a video on systemd by Learn Linux tv 
today i also installed arch Linux
I use arch,BTW!!!!!

so systemd can manage unit files that can be services, mounts and unmounts and some other stuff
it is the very first process when the system boots up
we can use systemctl to interact with systemd services such as:-
systemctl status
systemctl start [service name]
systemctl stop "..."
systemctl disable 
systemctl enable

after that i just looked up the files within /lib/systemd/system 
that's where i found initrd-switch-root
i saw what was in isystemd/system 
that's where i found initrd-switch-root
i saw what was in it.
[Unit] (managed by systemd)
Description=Switch Root

AssertPathExists=/etc/initrd-release (seems interesting)

DefaultDependencies=no
Wants=initrd-switch-root.target (ok need to check what is in it)
AllowIsolate=yes (don't know what that means)
OnFailure=emergency.target
OnFailureJobMode=replace-irreversibly

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=systemctl --no-block switch-root (can be very useful to give command to kernel in qemu)
