okay so basically i didn't do much for the last 2 days and today i just deleted
my previous logs. it is unfortunate but it is what it is.
i will be starting with a new slate from now on.
so anyways, i started researching on the linux kernel source code and the journey 
of compilling it and running it on qemu of my device 
it all started on 21st july. i read a bunch of documentation.
