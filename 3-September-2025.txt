 got a new error after i gave the following command:-

The superblock could not be read or does not describe a valid ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem.  If the device is valid and it really contains an ext2/ext3/ext4
filesystem (and not swap or ufs or something else), then the superblock
is corrupt, and you might try running e2fsck with an alternate superblock:
    e2fsck -b 8193 <device>
 or
    e2fsck -b 32768 <device>

another error i got after i gave root=/dev/sda3
:: mounting '/dev/sda3' on real root
mount: /new_root: unknown filesystem type 'btrfs'.
       dmesg(1) may have more information after failed mount system call.
ERROR: Failed to mount '/dev/sda3' on real root

sh: can't access tty; job control turned off

so the type of the fs is the problem after all
both the / and /home are of btrfs but the boot is ext4 so maybe that will work

lol it seems like that was the problem:-
after giving it /dev/sda2 which is type ext4 it gave me the following error which is cute:-
:: running cleanup hook [udev]
ERROR: Root device mounted successfully, but /sbin/init does not exist.
Bailing out, you are on your own. Good luck.
/sbin/init is pointing to systemd
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root      22 Aug  8 02:56 init -> ../lib/systemd/systemd



the problem probably lies in mkinitcpio or the way i configured the kernel
what is fsck?
