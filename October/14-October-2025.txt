what are huge pages?


what does performance hit mean?
it means reduction in speed or efficiency 

what is TLB(translation lookaside buffer)?
CPUs maintain a cache of
translations called Translation Lookaside Buffer (or
TLB). 
Usually TLB is pretty scarce(low in size) resource and applications with
large memory working set will experience performance hit(gets slower) because of
TLB misses.


so basically instead of walking all the levels of page tables to translate frequently used vms(virtual memory addresses) 
into physicall address we can just keep a cache memory(TLB) for the frequently used translations. 
this improves the efficiency by avoiding the entire walkthrough. 
higher the TLB hits, better the performances
higher TLB misses causes slow performances
higher TLB misses can be occured when the application has a large working memory set
