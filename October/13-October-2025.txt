what is cpumask?
used to manage a set of CPUs
decides which CPU manages which specific task
It’s essentially a bitmask where each bit corresponds to one CPU:

Bit = 1 → CPU is included in the set
Bit = 0 → CPU is excluded

what is a bitmask?
A bitmask is a way to store and manipulate multiple Boolean (on/off) values compactly using bits in an integer.

note:- linux kernel theoretically supports up to 4096CPUs, define using NR_CPUS.
NR_CPUS = maximum CPUs the kernel was compiled to handle.(4096)
num_possible_cpus() or num_online_cpus() = actual CPUs present or active.
So, if your system has only 8 CPUs, but NR_CPUS = 4096, you don’t need to allocate a full cpumask for 4096 bits in every mm_struct.
That’s why the kernel dynamically allocates a smaller one (just enough for your 8 CPUs).

init_mm is of type mm_struct
mm_struct is used to store info about process's memory — what it owns, where things are, etc.
init_mm is the very first memory descriptor used by the kernel itself — before and during system initialization.
it represents kernels own address space


designated initializers are better than normally initializing the values of properties of a structure.
No matter the order of declaration in the struct, the compiler assigns values to the correct members.
